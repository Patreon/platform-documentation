Webhooks allow you to receive real-time updates from our servers.
While there will eventually be many events about which you can be notified,
we presently only support webhooks that trigger when you get a new patron, or an existing patron edits or deletes their pledge.

By [creating a webhook](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-webhooks),
you can specify a URL for us to send an HTTP POST to when one of these events occur.
This POST request will contain the relevant data from the user action in JSON format. It will also have headers

<code>X-Patreon-Event: [trigger]<br>
X-Patreon-Signature: [message signature]</code>

where the message signature is the HEX digest of the message body HMAC signed (with MD5)
using your webhook's `secret` viewable on the [webhooks page](https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/webhooks).
You can use this to verify us as the sender of the message.

<aside class="warning">
It's important you don't share or expose your webhook secret!
</aside>

### Triggers

A `trigger` is an event type. The syntax of a trigger is `[resource]:[action]` (e.g. `pledges:create`). You can add or remove triggers for a webhook to listen to on the webhooks page.

Trigger | Description
------- | -----------
`pledge:create` | Fires when a user pledges to a creator. This trigger fires even if the charge is declined or fraudulent. The pledge object is still created, even if the user is not a valid patron due to charge status.
`pledge:update` | Fires when a user's pledge changes. Notably, the pledge ID will change, because the underlying pledge object is different.
`pledge:delete` | Fires when a user stops pledging or the pledge is cancelled altogether. Does _not_ stop for pledge pausing, as the pledge still exists.

### Robust Retries

To ensure that you can rely exclusively on webhooks data, we've put measures in place to make sure your server does not miss a single event. 

In case of failed delivery, perhaps due to network problems or server outages on your end, **we will store the events and make sure none were lost until your server is back up**. Over time, weâ€™ll try to send them to you and re-try your server. The next successful call to your server will include all the past webhooks that accumulated.

Our retry schedule is approximately as follows:

- 1 hour after first failure
- 3 hours later
- 1 day later
- 3 days later
- 1 week later
- 1 week later
- 1 week later
- Requires manual retry via our website

You can also use our [webhooks page] (https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-webhooks) to manually send yourself the queued messages.

### Programmatically Adding Webhooks

In addition to manually adding webhooks, you can also create, read, update, delete and list webhooks with our API. This feature is currently in early beta. If you would like to know more please contact us at [platform@patreon.com](mailto:platform@patreon.com).
