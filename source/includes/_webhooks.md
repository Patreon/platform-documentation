Webhooks allow you to receive real-time updates from our servers.
While eventually there will be many events about which you can be notified,
we presently only support webhooks that trigger when you get a new patron, or an existing patron edits or deletes their pledge.

By [creating a webhook](https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/webhooks),
you can specify a URL for us to send an HTTP POST to when one of these events occur.
This POST request will contain the relevant data from the user action in JSON format. It will also have headers

<code>X-Patreon-Event: [trigger]<br>
X-Patreon-Signature: [message signature]</code>

where the message signature is the HEX digest of the message body HMAC signed (with MD5)
using your webhook's `secret` viewable on the [webhooks page](https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/webhooks).
You can use this to verify us as the sender of the message.

<aside class="warning">
It's important you don't share or expose your webhook secret!

### Triggers

A `trigger` is an event type. The syntax of a trigger is `[resource]:[action]` (e.g. `pledges:create`). You can add or remove triggers for a webhook to listen to on the webhooks page.

### Retry Schedule

Network conditions and temporary outages mean that sometimes events won't reach your server on the first try.
Therefore, we store events so that the data isn't lost, and retry them at a tapering rate over the next month.
